  <h1>MOB PROGRAMMING</h1>

    <h2>One room, one group, one computer, one case. Mob programming is teamwork at its best.</h2>
    
    <p>Mob programming is a software development approach where one group - a mob - works together with the same thing at the same time in the same room and with the same computer and keyboard.</p>
    
    <p>Mob programming is an agile practice where the main purpose is to achieve a fast result with as high quality as possible. The team usually takes turns on managing the keyboard, writing the code, and focusing on what the next step will be and if the problem/case is being solved. The team consists of everyone involved in creating the software, including customers.</p>
